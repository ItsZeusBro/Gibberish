# GobbledyGook

Gobbledy gook is the subset of schema that is sufficiently generalizable to the extent that we can apply the same methods to it and always be doing something orderly, predictable, and useful with Gobbledy Gook utilities.

## Base Strings
But first, lets talk about something I call "Base Strings"

Base Strings is possibly a new subject of mathematics, in which we speak of non-recurrent strings as a first class object. Its like trying to find the pattern of patterns by generating things that have no pattern.

So what i've come up with so far is the distinction between hard and soft base strings:
1. Hard base strings require that we never display a pattern in a string from one end to the next
2. Soft base strings require that we never display a recursive pattern from the left most charachter of the string.

A good example of Hard Base Strings are pallindromes on alphabets. With the added caveat that the last letter in the alphabet is used once and all others are used twice.

The pallindrome base string set is when you find all the unique ordinal sets of the alphabet and construct the base pallindrome on the alphabet.

For example:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba
bacdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcab
bcadefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedacb
...
